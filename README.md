# Clojure Hnefatafl

A Clojure Implementation of the Fetlar Hnefatafl game.
For the official Fetlar rules check out this link
http://www.fetlar.org/assets/files/hnefatafl/rules2013visual.pdf

**Note:** This is still an early experimental version, that only works inside the Terminal.
If I have some free time I will release a version with graphical interface sooner or later.

## Installation

Download the game from https://github.com/Wegi/clojure-hnefatafl/releases/tag/v0.1

## Usage

To run the game you need to install `leiningen`.
Change inside the game folder and run the `lein run` command via your terminal
if you want to run the graphical version.  
Start the Terminal version with `lein run console`.  
You can also create a *jar with `lein uberjar`.
